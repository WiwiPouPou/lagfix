How to build Voodoo lagfix stages:

./scripts/download_and_extract_buildroot.sh

./scripts/restore_configs.sh
(quit the make menuconfig without changes)

./scripts/build_everything.sh
Have fun outside or if you have kids play with them
(or just wait)

And now your stages are fine :)


NEW - Alternative method - Use precompiled stages!
./scripts/download_precompiled_stages.sh

Your stages should be fine too.
If you have issues (missing binary) it means they are temporarly
obsolete, don't hesitate to place an issue on github.
In thea meantime you still can build from sources (always up-to-date)
